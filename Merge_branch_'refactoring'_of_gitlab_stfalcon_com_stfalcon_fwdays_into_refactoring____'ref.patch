-;   content length       - the content length of the request (only with POST);
-;   user                 - the user (PHP_AUTH_USER) (or '-' if not set);
-;   script               - the main script called (or '-' if not set);
-;   last request cpu     - the %cpu the last request consumed
-;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state
-;                          because CPU calculation is done when the request
-;                          processing has terminated;
-;   last request memory  - the max amount of memory the last request consumed
-;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state
-;                          because memory calculation is done when the request
-;                          processing has terminated;
-; If the process is in Idle state, then informations are related to the
-; last request the process has served. Otherwise informations are related to
-; the current request being served.

-;                                     PHP call 'ini_set'
-; For php_*flag, valid values are on, off, 1, 0, true, false, yes or no.
-
-; Defining 'extension' will load the corresponding shared extension from
-; extension_dir. Defining 'disable_functions' or 'disable_classes' will not
-; overwrite previously defined php.ini values, but will append the new value
-; instead.
-
-; Note: path INI options can be relative and will be expanded with the prefix
-; (pool, global or /usr)
-
-; Default Value: nothing is defined by default except the values in php.ini and
-;                specified at startup with the -d argument

-[PHP]
-
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; About php.ini   ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; PHP's initialization file, generally called php.ini, is responsible for
-; configuring many of the aspects of PHP's behavior.
-
-; PHP attempts to find and load this configuration from a number of locations.
-; The following is a summary of its search order:
-; 1. SAPI module specific location.
-; 2. The PHPRC environment variable. (As of PHP 5.2.0)
-; 3. A number of predefined registry keys on Windows (As of PHP 5.2.0)
-; 4. Current working directory (except CLI)
-; 5. The web server's directory (for SAPI modules), or directory of PHP
-; (otherwise in Windows)
-; 6. The directory from the --with-config-file-path compile time option, or the
-; Windows directory (C:\windows or C:\winnt)
-; See the PHP docs for more specific information.
-; http://php.net/configuration.file
-
-; The syntax of the file is extremely simple.  Whitespace and lines
-; beginning with a semicolon are silently ignored (as you probably guessed).
-; Section headers (e.g. [Foo]) are also silently ignored, even though
-; they might mean something in the future.
-
-; Directives following the section heading [PATH=/www/mysite] only
-; apply to PHP files in the /www/mysite directory.  Directives
-; following the section heading [HOST=www.example.com] only apply to
-; PHP files served from www.example.com.  Directives set in these
-; special sections cannot be overridden by user-defined INI files or
-; at runtime. Currently, [PATH=] and [HOST=] sections only work under
-; CGI/FastCGI.
-; http://php.net/ini.sections
-
-; Directives are specified using the following syntax:
-; directive = value
-; Directive names are *case sensitive* - foo=bar is different from FOO=bar.
-; Directives are variables used to configure PHP or PHP extensions.
-; There is no name validation.  If PHP can't find an expected
-; directive because it is not set or is mistyped, a default value will be used.
-
-; The value can be a string, a number, a PHP constant (e.g. E_ALL or M_PI), one
-; of the INI constants (On, Off, True, False, Yes, No and None) or an expression
-; (e.g. E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE), a quoted string ("bar"), or a reference to a
-; previously set variable or directive (e.g. ${foo})
-
-; Expressions in the INI file are limited to bitwise operators and parentheses:
-; |  bitwise OR
-; ^  bitwise XOR
-; &  bitwise AND
-; ~  bitwise NOT
-; !  boolean NOT
-
-; Boolean flags can be turned on using the values 1, On, True or Yes.
-; They can be turned off using the values 0, Off, False or No.
-
-; An empty string can be denoted by simply not writing anything after the equal
-; sign, or by using the None keyword:
-
-;  foo =         ; sets foo to an empty string
-;  foo = None    ; sets foo to an empty string
-;  foo = "None"  ; sets foo to the string 'None'
-
-; If you use constants in your value, and these constants belong to a
-; dynamically loaded extension (either a PHP extension or a Zend extension),
-; you may only use these constants *after* the line that loads the extension.
-
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; About this file ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; PHP comes packaged with two INI files. One that is recommended to be used
-; in production environments and one that is recommended to be used in
-; development environments.
-
-; php.ini-production contains settings which hold security, performance and
-; best practices at its core. But please be aware, these settings may break
-; compatibility with older or less security conscience applications. We
-; recommending using the production ini in production and testing environments.
-
-; php.ini-development is very similar to its production variant, except it is
-; much more verbose when it comes to errors. We recommend using the
-; development version only in development environments, as errors shown to
-; application users can inadvertently leak otherwise secure information.
-
-; This is php.ini-production INI file.
-
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; Quick Reference ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; The following are all the settings which are different in either the production
-; or development versions of the INIs with respect to PHP's default behavior.
-; Please see the actual settings later in the document for more details as to why
-; we recommend these changes in PHP's behavior.

-;user_ini.filename = ".user.ini"
-
-; To disable this feature set this option to empty value
-;user_ini.filename =
-
-; TTL for user-defined php.ini files (time-to-live) in seconds. Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes)
-;user_ini.cache_ttl = 300
-
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; Language Options ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-
-; Enable the PHP scripting language engine under Apache.
-; http://php.net/engine
-engine = On
-
-; This directive determines whether or not PHP will recognize code between
-; <? and ?> tags as PHP source which should be processed as such. It is
-; generally recommended that <?php and ?> should be used and that this feature
-; should be disabled, as enabling it may result in issues when generating XML
-; documents, however this remains supported for backward compatibility reasons.
-; Note that this directive does not control the <?= shorthand tag, which can be
-; used regardless of this directive.
-; Default Value: On
-; Development Value: Off
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/short-open-tag
-short_open_tag = Off
-
-; The number of significant digits displayed in floating point numbers.
-; http://php.net/precision
-precision = 14
-
-; Output buffering is a mechanism for controlling how much output data
-; (excluding headers and cookies) PHP should keep internally before pushing that
-; data to the client. If your application's output exceeds this setting, PHP
-; will send that data in chunks of roughly the size you specify.
-; Turning on this setting and managing its maximum buffer size can yield some
-; interesting side-effects depending on your application and web server.
-; You may be able to send headers and cookies after you've already sent output
-; through print or echo. You also may see performance benefits if your server is
-; emitting less packets due to buffered output versus PHP streaming the output
-; as it gets it. On production servers, 4096 bytes is a good setting for performance
-; reasons.
-; Note: Output buffering can also be controlled via Output Buffering Control
-;   functions.
-; Possible Values:
-;   On = Enabled and buffer is unlimited. (Use with caution)
-;   Off = Disabled
-;   Integer = Enables the buffer and sets its maximum size in bytes.
-; Note: This directive is hardcoded to Off for the CLI SAPI
-; Default Value: Off
-; Development Value: 4096
-; Production Value: 4096
-; http://php.net/output-buffering
-output_buffering = 4096
-
-; You can redirect all of the output of your scripts to a function.  For
-; example, if you set output_handler to "mb_output_handler", character
-; encoding will be transparently converted to the specified encoding.
-; Setting any output handler automatically turns on output buffering.
-; Note: People who wrote portable scripts should not depend on this ini
-;   directive. Instead, explicitly set the output handler using ob_start().
-;   Using this ini directive may cause problems unless you know what script
-;   is doing.
-; Note: You cannot use both "mb_output_handler" with "ob_iconv_handler"
-;   and you cannot use both "ob_gzhandler" and "zlib.output_compression".
-; Note: output_handler must be empty if this is set 'On' !!!!
-;   Instead you must use zlib.output_handler.
-; http://php.net/output-handler
-;output_handler =
-
-; URL rewriter function rewrites URL on the fly by using
-; output buffer. You can set target tags by this configuration.
-; "form" tag is special tag. It will add hidden input tag to pass values.
-; Refer to session.trans_sid_tags for usage.
-; Default Value: "form="
-; Development Value: "form="
-; Production Value: "form="
-;url_rewriter.tags
-
-; URL rewriter will not rewrites absolute URL nor form by default. To enable
-; absolute URL rewrite, allowed hosts must be defined at RUNTIME.
-; Refer to session.trans_sid_hosts for more details.
-; Default Value: ""
-; Development Value: ""
-; Production Value: ""
-;url_rewriter.hosts
-
-; Transparent output compression using the zlib library
-; Valid values for this option are 'off', 'on', or a specific buffer size
-; to be used for compression (default is 4KB)
-; Note: Resulting chunk size may vary due to nature of compression. PHP
-;   outputs chunks that are few hundreds bytes each as a result of
-;   compression. If you prefer a larger chunk size for better
-;   performance, enable output_buffering in addition.
-; Note: You need to use zlib.output_handler instead of the standard
-;   output_handler, or otherwise the output will be corrupted.
-; http://php.net/zlib.output-compression
-zlib.output_compression = Off
-
-; http://php.net/zlib.output-compression-level
-;zlib.output_compression_level = -1
-
-; You cannot specify additional output handlers if zlib.output_compression
-; is activated here. This setting does the same as output_handler but in
-; a different order.
-; http://php.net/zlib.output-handler
-;zlib.output_handler =
-
-; Implicit flush tells PHP to tell the output layer to flush itself
-; automatically after every output block.  This is equivalent to calling the
-; PHP function flush() after each and every call to print() or echo() and each
-; and every HTML block.  Turning this option on has serious performance
-; implications and is generally recommended for debugging purposes only.
-; http://php.net/implicit-flush
-; Note: This directive is hardcoded to On for the CLI SAPI
-implicit_flush = Off
-
-; The unserialize callback function will be called (with the undefined class'
-; name as parameter), if the unserializer finds an undefined class
-; which should be instantiated. A warning appears if the specified function is
-; not defined, or if the function doesn't include/implement the missing class.
-; So only set this entry, if you really want to implement such a
-; callback-function.
-unserialize_callback_func =
-
-; When floats & doubles are serialized store serialize_precision significant
-; digits after the floating point. The default value ensures that when floats
-; are decoded with unserialize, the data will remain the same.
-; The value is also used for json_encode when encoding double values.
-; If -1 is used, then dtoa mode 0 is used which automatically select the best
-; precision.
-serialize_precision = -1
-
-; open_basedir, if set, limits all file operations to the defined directory
-; and below.  This directive makes most sense if used in a per-directory
-; or per-virtualhost web server configuration file.
-; http://php.net/open-basedir
-;open_basedir =
-
-; This directive allows you to disable certain functions for security reasons.
-; It receives a comma-delimited list of function names.
-; http://php.net/disable-functions
-disable_functions =
-
-; This directive allows you to disable certain classes for security reasons.
-; It receives a comma-delimited list of class names.
-; http://php.net/disable-classes
-disable_classes =
-
-; Colors for Syntax Highlighting mode.  Anything that's acceptable in
-; <span style="color: ???????"> would work.
-; http://php.net/syntax-highlighting
-;highlight.string  = #DD0000
-;highlight.comment = #FF9900
-;highlight.keyword = #007700
-;highlight.default = #0000BB
-;highlight.html    = #000000
-
-; If enabled, the request will be allowed to complete even if the user aborts
-; the request. Consider enabling it if executing long requests, which may end up
-; being interrupted by the user or a browser timing out. PHP's default behavior
-; is to disable this feature.
-; http://php.net/ignore-user-abort
-;ignore_user_abort = On
-
-; Determines the size of the realpath cache to be used by PHP. This value should
-; be increased on systems where PHP opens many files to reflect the quantity of
-; the file operations performed.
-; http://php.net/realpath-cache-size
-;realpath_cache_size = 4096k
-
-; Duration of time, in seconds for which to cache realpath information for a given
-; file or directory. For systems with rarely changing files, consider increasing this
-; value.
-; http://php.net/realpath-cache-ttl
-;realpath_cache_ttl = 120
-
-; Enables or disables the circular reference collector.
-; http://php.net/zend.enable-gc
-zend.enable_gc = On
-
-; If enabled, scripts may be written in encodings that are incompatible with
-; the scanner.  CP936, Big5, CP949 and Shift_JIS are the examples of such
-; encodings.  To use this feature, mbstring extension must be enabled.
-; Default: Off
-;zend.multibyte = Off
-
-; Allows to set the default encoding for the scripts.  This value will be used
-; unless "declare(encoding=...)" directive appears at the top of the script.
-; Only affects if zend.multibyte is set.

-max_execution_time = 30
-
-; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data. It's a good
-; idea to limit this time on productions servers in order to eliminate unexpectedly
-; long running scripts.
-; Note: This directive is hardcoded to -1 for the CLI SAPI

-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; Error handling and logging ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-
-; This directive informs PHP of which errors, warnings and notices you would like
-; it to take action for. The recommended way of setting values for this
-; directive is through the use of the error level constants and bitwise
-; operators. The error level constants are below here for convenience as well as
-; some common settings and their meanings.
-; By default, PHP is set to take action on all errors, notices and warnings EXCEPT
-; those related to E_NOTICE and E_STRICT, which together cover best practices and
-; recommended coding standards in PHP. For performance reasons, this is the
-; recommend error reporting setting. Your production server shouldn't be wasting
-; resources complaining about best practices and coding standards. That's what
-; development servers and development settings are for.
-; Note: The php.ini-development file has this setting as E_ALL. This
-; means it pretty much reports everything which is exactly what you want during
-; development and early testing.
-;
-; Error Level Constants:
-; E_ALL             - All errors and warnings (includes E_STRICT as of PHP 5.4.0)
-; E_ERROR           - fatal run-time errors
-; E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR  - almost fatal run-time errors
-; E_WARNING         - run-time warnings (non-fatal errors)
-; E_PARSE           - compile-time parse errors
-; E_NOTICE          - run-time notices (these are warnings which often result
-;                     from a bug in your code, but it's possible that it was
-;                     intentional (e.g., using an uninitialized variable and
-;                     relying on the fact it is automatically initialized to an
-;                     empty string)
-; E_STRICT          - run-time notices, enable to have PHP suggest changes
-;                     to your code which will ensure the best interoperability
-;                     and forward compatibility of your code
-; E_CORE_ERROR      - fatal errors that occur during PHP's initial startup
-; E_CORE_WARNING    - warnings (non-fatal errors) that occur during PHP's
-;                     initial startup
-; E_COMPILE_ERROR   - fatal compile-time errors
-; E_COMPILE_WARNING - compile-time warnings (non-fatal errors)
-; E_USER_ERROR      - user-generated error message
-; E_USER_WARNING    - user-generated warning message
-; E_USER_NOTICE     - user-generated notice message
-; E_DEPRECATED      - warn about code that will not work in future versions
-;                     of PHP
-; E_USER_DEPRECATED - user-generated deprecation warnings
-;
-; Common Values:
-;   E_ALL (Show all errors, warnings and notices including coding standards.)
-;   E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE  (Show all errors, except for notices)

-
-; This directive controls whether or not and where PHP will output errors,
-; notices and warnings too. Error output is very useful during development, but
-; it could be very dangerous in production environments. Depending on the code
-; which is triggering the error, sensitive information could potentially leak
-; out of your application such as database usernames and passwords or worse.
-; For production environments, we recommend logging errors rather than
-; sending them to STDOUT.
-; Possible Values:
-;   Off = Do not display any errors
-;   stderr = Display errors to STDERR (affects only CGI/CLI binaries!)
-;   On or stdout = Display errors to STDOUT
-; Default Value: On
-; Development Value: On
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/display-errors
-display_errors = Off
-
-; The display of errors which occur during PHP's startup sequence are handled
-; separately from display_errors. PHP's default behavior is to suppress those
-; errors from clients. Turning the display of startup errors on can be useful in
-; debugging configuration problems. We strongly recommend you
-; set this to 'off' for production servers.
-; Default Value: Off
-; Development Value: On
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/display-startup-errors
-display_startup_errors = Off
-
-; Besides displaying errors, PHP can also log errors to locations such as a
-; server-specific log, STDERR, or a location specified by the error_log
-; directive found below. While errors should not be displayed on productions
-; servers they should still be monitored and logging is a great way to do that.
-; Default Value: Off
-; Development Value: On
-; Production Value: On
-; http://php.net/log-errors
-log_errors = On
-
-; Set maximum length of log_errors. In error_log information about the source is

-; http://php.net/log-errors-max-len
-log_errors_max_len = 1024
-
-; Do not log repeated messages. Repeated errors must occur in same file on same
-; line unless ignore_repeated_source is set true.
-; http://php.net/ignore-repeated-errors
-ignore_repeated_errors = Off

-; Ignore source of message when ignoring repeated messages. When this setting
-; is On you will not log errors with repeated messages from different files or

-; http://php.net/ignore-repeated-source
-ignore_repeated_source = Off

-; This setting is on by default.
-;report_zend_debug = 0
-
-; Store the last error/warning message in $php_errormsg (boolean). Setting this value

-; When PHP displays or logs an error, it has the capability of formatting the
-; error message as HTML for easier reading. This directive controls whether
-; the error message is formatted as HTML or not.

-; Default Value: On
-; Development Value: On
-; Production value: On
-; http://php.net/html-errors
-html_errors = On
-
-; If html_errors is set to On *and* docref_root is not empty, then PHP
-; produces clickable error messages that direct to a page describing the error
-; or function causing the error in detail.
-; You can download a copy of the PHP manual from http://php.net/docs
-; and change docref_root to the base URL of your local copy including the
-; leading '/'. You must also specify the file extension being used including
-; the dot. PHP's default behavior is to leave these settings empty, in which
-; case no links to documentation are generated.
-; Note: Never use this feature for production boxes.

-;docref_root = "/phpmanual/"

-; This directive determines which super global arrays are registered when PHP
-; starts up. G,P,C,E & S are abbreviations for the following respective super
-; globals: GET, POST, COOKIE, ENV and SERVER. There is a performance penalty
-; paid for the registration of these arrays and because ENV is not as commonly
-; used as the others, ENV is not recommended on productions servers. You
-; can still get access to the environment variables through getenv() should you
-; need to.

-
-; This directive determines which super global data (G,P & C) should be

-; the order in which that data is registered. The values for this directive
-; are specified in the same manner as the variables_order directive,
-; EXCEPT one. Leaving this value empty will cause PHP to use the value set
-; in the variables_order directive. It does not mean it will leave the super
-; globals array REQUEST empty.
-; Default Value: None
-; Development Value: "GP"
-; Production Value: "GP"
-; http://php.net/request-order
-request_order = "GP"
-
-; This directive determines whether PHP registers $argv & $argc each time it
-; runs. $argv contains an array of all the arguments passed to PHP when a script
-; is invoked. $argc contains an integer representing the number of arguments
-; that were passed when the script was invoked. These arrays are extremely
-; useful when running scripts from the command line. When this directive is
-; enabled, registering these variables consumes CPU cycles and memory each time
-; a script is executed. For performance reasons, this feature should be disabled
-; on production servers.
-; Note: This directive is hardcoded to On for the CLI SAPI
-; Default Value: On
-; Development Value: Off
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/register-argc-argv

-
-; When enabled, the ENV, REQUEST and SERVER variables are created when they're

-;
-; The path can be defined as:
-;
-;     session.save_path = "N;/path"
-;
-; where N is an integer.  Instead of storing all the session files in
-; /path, what this will do is use subdirectories N-levels deep, and
-; store the session data in those directories.  This is useful if

-; a more efficient layout for servers that handle many sessions.
-;
-; NOTE 1: PHP will not create this directory structure automatically.
-;         You can use the script in the ext/session dir for that purpose.

-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; About php.ini   ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; PHP's initialization file, generally called php.ini, is responsible for
-; configuring many of the aspects of PHP's behavior.
-
-; PHP attempts to find and load this configuration from a number of locations.
-; The following is a summary of its search order:
-; 1. SAPI module specific location.
-; 2. The PHPRC environment variable. (As of PHP 5.2.0)
-; 3. A number of predefined registry keys on Windows (As of PHP 5.2.0)
-; 4. Current working directory (except CLI)
-; 5. The web server's directory (for SAPI modules), or directory of PHP
-; (otherwise in Windows)
-; 6. The directory from the --with-config-file-path compile time option, or the
-; Windows directory (C:\windows or C:\winnt)
-; See the PHP docs for more specific information.
-; http://php.net/configuration.file
-
-; The syntax of the file is extremely simple.  Whitespace and lines
-; beginning with a semicolon are silently ignored (as you probably guessed).
-; Section headers (e.g. [Foo]) are also silently ignored, even though
-; they might mean something in the future.
-
-; Directives following the section heading [PATH=/www/mysite] only
-; apply to PHP files in the /www/mysite directory.  Directives
-; following the section heading [HOST=www.example.com] only apply to
-; PHP files served from www.example.com.  Directives set in these
-; special sections cannot be overridden by user-defined INI files or
-; at runtime. Currently, [PATH=] and [HOST=] sections only work under
-; CGI/FastCGI.
-; http://php.net/ini.sections
-
-; Directives are specified using the following syntax:
-; directive = value
-; Directive names are *case sensitive* - foo=bar is different from FOO=bar.
-; Directives are variables used to configure PHP or PHP extensions.
-; There is no name validation.  If PHP can't find an expected
-; directive because it is not set or is mistyped, a default value will be used.
-
-; The value can be a string, a number, a PHP constant (e.g. E_ALL or M_PI), one
-; of the INI constants (On, Off, True, False, Yes, No and None) or an expression
-; (e.g. E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE), a quoted string ("bar"), or a reference to a
-; previously set variable or directive (e.g. ${foo})
-
-; Expressions in the INI file are limited to bitwise operators and parentheses:
-; |  bitwise OR
-; ^  bitwise XOR
-; &  bitwise AND
-; ~  bitwise NOT
-; !  boolean NOT
-
-; Boolean flags can be turned on using the values 1, On, True or Yes.
-; They can be turned off using the values 0, Off, False or No.
-
-; An empty string can be denoted by simply not writing anything after the equal
-; sign, or by using the None keyword:
-
-;  foo =         ; sets foo to an empty string
-;  foo = None    ; sets foo to an empty string
-;  foo = "None"  ; sets foo to the string 'None'
-
-; If you use constants in your value, and these constants belong to a
-; dynamically loaded extension (either a PHP extension or a Zend extension),
-; you may only use these constants *after* the line that loads the extension.
-
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; About this file ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; PHP comes packaged with two INI files. One that is recommended to be used
-; in production environments and one that is recommended to be used in
-; development environments.
-
-; php.ini-production contains settings which hold security, performance and
-; best practices at its core. But please be aware, these settings may break
-; compatibility with older or less security conscience applications. We
-; recommending using the production ini in production and testing environments.
-
-; php.ini-development is very similar to its production variant, except it is
-; much more verbose when it comes to errors. We recommend using the
-; development version only in development environments, as errors shown to
-; application users can inadvertently leak otherwise secure information.
-
-; This is php.ini-production INI file.
-
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; Quick Reference ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; The following are all the settings which are different in either the production
-; or development versions of the INIs with respect to PHP's default behavior.
-; Please see the actual settings later in the document for more details as to why
-; we recommend these changes in PHP's behavior.

-
-; To disable this feature set this option to empty value

-
-; TTL for user-defined php.ini files (time-to-live) in seconds. Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes)
-;user_ini.cache_ttl = 300
-
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; Language Options ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-
-; Enable the PHP scripting language engine under Apache.
-; http://php.net/engine
-engine = On
-
-; This directive determines whether or not PHP will recognize code between
-; <? and ?> tags as PHP source which should be processed as such. It is
-; generally recommended that <?php and ?> should be used and that this feature
-; should be disabled, as enabling it may result in issues when generating XML
-; documents, however this remains supported for backward compatibility reasons.
-; Note that this directive does not control the <?= shorthand tag, which can be
-; used regardless of this directive.
-; Default Value: On
-; Development Value: Off
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/short-open-tag
-short_open_tag = Off
-
-; The number of significant digits displayed in floating point numbers.
-; http://php.net/precision
-precision = 14
-
-; Output buffering is a mechanism for controlling how much output data
-; (excluding headers and cookies) PHP should keep internally before pushing that
-; data to the client. If your application's output exceeds this setting, PHP
-; will send that data in chunks of roughly the size you specify.
-; Turning on this setting and managing its maximum buffer size can yield some
-; interesting side-effects depending on your application and web server.
-; You may be able to send headers and cookies after you've already sent output
-; through print or echo. You also may see performance benefits if your server is
-; emitting less packets due to buffered output versus PHP streaming the output
-; as it gets it. On production servers, 4096 bytes is a good setting for performance
-; reasons.
-; Note: Output buffering can also be controlled via Output Buffering Control
-;   functions.
-; Possible Values:
-;   On = Enabled and buffer is unlimited. (Use with caution)
-;   Off = Disabled
-;   Integer = Enables the buffer and sets its maximum size in bytes.
-; Note: This directive is hardcoded to Off for the CLI SAPI
-; Default Value: Off
-; Development Value: 4096
-; Production Value: 4096
-; http://php.net/output-buffering
-output_buffering = 4096
-
-; You can redirect all of the output of your scripts to a function.  For
-; example, if you set output_handler to "mb_output_handler", character
-; encoding will be transparently converted to the specified encoding.
-; Setting any output handler automatically turns on output buffering.
-; Note: People who wrote portable scripts should not depend on this ini
-;   directive. Instead, explicitly set the output handler using ob_start().
-;   Using this ini directive may cause problems unless you know what script
-;   is doing.
-; Note: You cannot use both "mb_output_handler" with "ob_iconv_handler"
-;   and you cannot use both "ob_gzhandler" and "zlib.output_compression".
-; Note: output_handler must be empty if this is set 'On' !!!!
-;   Instead you must use zlib.output_handler.
-; http://php.net/output-handler
-;output_handler =
-
-; URL rewriter function rewrites URL on the fly by using
-; output buffer. You can set target tags by this configuration.
-; "form" tag is special tag. It will add hidden input tag to pass values.
-; Refer to session.trans_sid_tags for usage.
-; Default Value: "form="
-; Development Value: "form="
-; Production Value: "form="
-;url_rewriter.tags
-
-; URL rewriter will not rewrites absolute URL nor form by default. To enable
-; absolute URL rewrite, allowed hosts must be defined at RUNTIME.
-; Refer to session.trans_sid_hosts for more details.
-; Default Value: ""
-; Development Value: ""
-; Production Value: ""
-;url_rewriter.hosts
-
-; Transparent output compression using the zlib library
-; Valid values for this option are 'off', 'on', or a specific buffer size
-; to be used for compression (default is 4KB)
-; Note: Resulting chunk size may vary due to nature of compression. PHP
-;   outputs chunks that are few hundreds bytes each as a result of
-;   compression. If you prefer a larger chunk size for better
-;   performance, enable output_buffering in addition.
-; Note: You need to use zlib.output_handler instead of the standard
-;   output_handler, or otherwise the output will be corrupted.
-; http://php.net/zlib.output-compression
-zlib.output_compression = Off
-
-; http://php.net/zlib.output-compression-level
-;zlib.output_compression_level = -1
-
-; You cannot specify additional output handlers if zlib.output_compression
-; is activated here. This setting does the same as output_handler but in
-; a different order.
-; http://php.net/zlib.output-handler
-;zlib.output_handler =
-
-; Implicit flush tells PHP to tell the output layer to flush itself
-; automatically after every output block.  This is equivalent to calling the
-; PHP function flush() after each and every call to print() or echo() and each
-; and every HTML block.  Turning this option on has serious performance
-; implications and is generally recommended for debugging purposes only.
-; http://php.net/implicit-flush
-; Note: This directive is hardcoded to On for the CLI SAPI
-implicit_flush = Off
-
-; The unserialize callback function will be called (with the undefined class'
-; name as parameter), if the unserializer finds an undefined class
-; which should be instantiated. A warning appears if the specified function is
-; not defined, or if the function doesn't include/implement the missing class.
-; So only set this entry, if you really want to implement such a
-; callback-function.
-unserialize_callback_func =
-
-; When floats & doubles are serialized store serialize_precision significant
-; digits after the floating point. The default value ensures that when floats
-; are decoded with unserialize, the data will remain the same.
-; The value is also used for json_encode when encoding double values.
-; If -1 is used, then dtoa mode 0 is used which automatically select the best
-; precision.
-serialize_precision = -1
-
-; open_basedir, if set, limits all file operations to the defined directory
-; and below.  This directive makes most sense if used in a per-directory
-; or per-virtualhost web server configuration file.

-; Error handling and logging ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-
-; This directive informs PHP of which errors, warnings and notices you would like
-; it to take action for. The recommended way of setting values for this
-; directive is through the use of the error level constants and bitwise
-; operators. The error level constants are below here for convenience as well as
-; some common settings and their meanings.
-; By default, PHP is set to take action on all errors, notices and warnings EXCEPT
-; those related to E_NOTICE and E_STRICT, which together cover best practices and
-; recommended coding standards in PHP. For performance reasons, this is the
-; recommend error reporting setting. Your production server shouldn't be wasting
-; resources complaining about best practices and coding standards. That's what
-; development servers and development settings are for.
-; Note: The php.ini-development file has this setting as E_ALL. This
-; means it pretty much reports everything which is exactly what you want during
-; development and early testing.
-;
-; Error Level Constants:
-; E_ALL             - All errors and warnings (includes E_STRICT as of PHP 5.4.0)
-; E_ERROR           - fatal run-time errors
-; E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR  - almost fatal run-time errors
-; E_WARNING         - run-time warnings (non-fatal errors)
-; E_PARSE           - compile-time parse errors
-; E_NOTICE          - run-time notices (these are warnings which often result
-;                     from a bug in your code, but it's possible that it was
-;                     intentional (e.g., using an uninitialized variable and
-;                     relying on the fact it is automatically initialized to an
-;                     empty string)
-; E_STRICT          - run-time notices, enable to have PHP suggest changes
-;                     to your code which will ensure the best interoperability
-;                     and forward compatibility of your code
-; E_CORE_ERROR      - fatal errors that occur during PHP's initial startup
-; E_CORE_WARNING    - warnings (non-fatal errors) that occur during PHP's
-;                     initial startup
-; E_COMPILE_ERROR   - fatal compile-time errors
-; E_COMPILE_WARNING - compile-time warnings (non-fatal errors)
-; E_USER_ERROR      - user-generated error message
-; E_USER_WARNING    - user-generated warning message
-; E_USER_NOTICE     - user-generated notice message
-; E_DEPRECATED      - warn about code that will not work in future versions
-;                     of PHP
-; E_USER_DEPRECATED - user-generated deprecation warnings
-;
-; Common Values:

-
-; This directive controls whether or not and where PHP will output errors,
-; notices and warnings too. Error output is very useful during development, but
-; it could be very dangerous in production environments. Depending on the code
-; which is triggering the error, sensitive information could potentially leak
-; out of your application such as database usernames and passwords or worse.
-; For production environments, we recommend logging errors rather than
-; sending them to STDOUT.
-; Possible Values:
-;   Off = Do not display any errors
-;   stderr = Display errors to STDERR (affects only CGI/CLI binaries!)
-;   On or stdout = Display errors to STDOUT
-; Default Value: On
-; Development Value: On
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/display-errors
-display_errors = Off
-
-; The display of errors which occur during PHP's startup sequence are handled
-; separately from display_errors. PHP's default behavior is to suppress those
-; errors from clients. Turning the display of startup errors on can be useful in
-; debugging configuration problems. We strongly recommend you
-; set this to 'off' for production servers.
-; Default Value: Off
-; Development Value: On
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/display-startup-errors
-display_startup_errors = Off
-
-; Besides displaying errors, PHP can also log errors to locations such as a
-; server-specific log, STDERR, or a location specified by the error_log
-; directive found below. While errors should not be displayed on productions
-; servers they should still be monitored and logging is a great way to do that.
-; Default Value: Off
-; Development Value: On
-; Production Value: On
-; http://php.net/log-errors
-log_errors = On
-
-; Set maximum length of log_errors. In error_log information about the source is

-; http://php.net/log-errors-max-len
-log_errors_max_len = 1024
-
-; Do not log repeated messages. Repeated errors must occur in same file on same
-; line unless ignore_repeated_source is set true.
-; http://php.net/ignore-repeated-errors
-ignore_repeated_errors = Off
-
-; Ignore source of message when ignoring repeated messages. When this setting
-; is On you will not log errors with repeated messages from different files or
-; source lines.
-; http://php.net/ignore-repeated-source
-ignore_repeated_source = Off
-
-; If this parameter is set to Off, then memory leaks will not be shown (on

-report_memleaks = On
-
-; This setting is on by default.
-;report_zend_debug = 0
-
-; Store the last error/warning message in $php_errormsg (boolean). Setting this value

-; When PHP displays or logs an error, it has the capability of formatting the
-; error message as HTML for easier reading. This directive controls whether
-; the error message is formatted as HTML or not.
-; Note: This directive is hardcoded to Off for the CLI SAPI
-; Default Value: On
-; Development Value: On
-; Production value: On
-; http://php.net/html-errors
-html_errors = On
-
-; If html_errors is set to On *and* docref_root is not empty, then PHP
-; produces clickable error messages that direct to a page describing the error
-; or function causing the error in detail.
-; You can download a copy of the PHP manual from http://php.net/docs
-; and change docref_root to the base URL of your local copy including the
-; leading '/'. You must also specify the file extension being used including
-; the dot. PHP's default behavior is to leave these settings empty, in which
-; case no links to documentation are generated.
-; Note: Never use this feature for production boxes.

-;docref_root = "/phpmanual/"

-; This directive determines which super global arrays are registered when PHP
-; starts up. G,P,C,E & S are abbreviations for the following respective super
-; globals: GET, POST, COOKIE, ENV and SERVER. There is a performance penalty
-; paid for the registration of these arrays and because ENV is not as commonly
-; used as the others, ENV is not recommended on productions servers. You
-; can still get access to the environment variables through getenv() should you
-; need to.

-
-; This directive determines which super global data (G,P & C) should be
-; registered into the super global array REQUEST. If so, it also determines
-; the order in which that data is registered. The values for this directive
-; are specified in the same manner as the variables_order directive,
-; EXCEPT one. Leaving this value empty will cause PHP to use the value set
-; in the variables_order directive. It does not mean it will leave the super
-; globals array REQUEST empty.
-; Default Value: None
-; Development Value: "GP"
-; Production Value: "GP"
-; http://php.net/request-order
-request_order = "GP"
-
-; This directive determines whether PHP registers $argv & $argc each time it
-; runs. $argv contains an array of all the arguments passed to PHP when a script
-; is invoked. $argc contains an integer representing the number of arguments
-; that were passed when the script was invoked. These arrays are extremely
-; useful when running scripts from the command line. When this directive is
-; enabled, registering these variables consumes CPU cycles and memory each time
-; a script is executed. For performance reasons, this feature should be disabled
-; on production servers.
-; Note: This directive is hardcoded to On for the CLI SAPI
-; Default Value: On
-; Development Value: Off
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/register-argc-argv

-
-; When enabled, the ENV, REQUEST and SERVER variables are created when they're

-;
-; The path can be defined as:
-;
-;     session.save_path = "N;/path"
-;
-; where N is an integer.  Instead of storing all the session files in
-; /path, what this will do is use subdirectories N-levels deep, and
-; store the session data in those directories.  This is useful if

-; a more efficient layout for servers that handle many sessions.
-;
-; NOTE 1: PHP will not create this directory structure automatically.
-;         You can use the script in the ext/session dir for that purpose.

-                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
-
- Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-                            Preamble
-
-  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
-software and other kinds of works.
-
-  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
-to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
-the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
-share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
-software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
-GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
-any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
-your programs, too.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
-want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
-free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
-these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
-certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
-you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
-freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
-or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
-know their rights.
-
-  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
-(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
-giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
-
-  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
-that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
-authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
-changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
-authors of previous versions.
-
-  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
-modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
-can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
-protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
-pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
-use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
-have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
-products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
-stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
-of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
-
-  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
-States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
-software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
-avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
-make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
-patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.
-
-                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-  0. Definitions.
-
-  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
-
-  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
-works, such as semiconductor masks.
-
-  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
-License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
-"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
-
-  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
-in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
-exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
-earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
-
-  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
-on the Program.
-
-  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
-permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
-infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
-computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
-distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
-public, and in some countries other activities as well.
-
-  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
-parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
-a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
-
-  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
-to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
-feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
-tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
-extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
-work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
-the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
-menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
-
-  1. Source Code.
-
-  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
-for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
-form of a work.
-
-  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
-standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
-interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
-is widely used among developers working in that language.
-
-  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
-than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
-packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
-Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
-Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
-implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
-"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
-(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
-(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
-produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
-
-  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
-the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
-work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
-control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
-System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
-programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
-which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
-includes interface definition files associated with source files for
-the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
-linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
-such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
-subprograms and other parts of the work.
-
-  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
-can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
-Source.
-
-  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
-same work.
-
-  2. Basic Permissions.
-
-  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
-copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
-conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
-permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
-covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
-content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
-rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
-
-  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
-convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
-in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
-of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
-with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
-the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
-not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
-for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
-and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
-your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
-
-  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
-the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
-makes it unnecessary.
-
-  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
-
-  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
-measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
-11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
-similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
-measures.
-
-  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
-circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
-is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
-the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
-modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
-users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
-technological measures.
-
-  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
-
-  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
-receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
-keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
-non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
-keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
-recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
-and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
-
-  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
-
-  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
-produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
-terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
-    it, and giving a relevant date.
-
-    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
-    released under this License and any conditions added under section
-    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
-    "keep intact all notices".
-
-    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
-    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
-    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
-    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
-    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
-    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
-    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
-
-    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
-    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
-    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
-    work need not make them do so.
-
-  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
-works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
-and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
-in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
-"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
-used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
-beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
-in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
-parts of the aggregate.
-
-  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
-
-  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
-of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
-machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
-in one of these ways:
-
-    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
-    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
-    customarily used for software interchange.
-
-    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
-    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
-    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
-    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
-    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
-    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
-    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
-    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
-    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
-    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
-
-    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
-    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
-    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
-    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
-    with subsection 6b.
-
-    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
-    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
-    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
-    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
-    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
-    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
-    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
-    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
-    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
-    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
-    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
-    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
-
-    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
-    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
-    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
-    charge under subsection 6d.
-
-  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
-from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
-included in conveying the object code work.
-
-  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
-tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
-or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
-into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
-doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
-product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
-typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
-of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
-actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
-is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
-commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
-the only significant mode of use of the product.
-
-  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
-procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
-and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
-a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
-suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
-code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
-modification has been made.
-
-  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
-specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
-part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
-User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
-fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
-Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
-by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
-if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
-modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
-been installed in ROM).
-
-  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
-requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
-for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
-the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
-network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
-adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
-protocols for communication across the network.
-
-  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
-in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
-documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
-source code form), and must require no special password or key for
-unpacking, reading or copying.
-
-  7. Additional Terms.
-
-  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
-License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
-Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
-be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
-that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
-apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
-under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
-this License without regard to the additional permissions.
-
-  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
-remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
-it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
-removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
-additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
-for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
-
-  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
-add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
-that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
-
-    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
-    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
-
-    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
-    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
-    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
-
-    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
-    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
-    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
-
-    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
-    authors of the material; or
-
-    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
-    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
-
-    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
-    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
-    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
-    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
-    those licensors and authors.
-
-  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
-restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
-received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
-governed by this License along with a term that is a further
-restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
-a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
-License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
-of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
-not survive such relicensing or conveying.
-
-  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
-must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
-additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
-where to find the applicable terms.
-
-  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
-form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
-the above requirements apply either way.
-
-  8. Termination.
-
-  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
-provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
-modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
-this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
-paragraph of section 11).
-
-  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
-license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
-provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
-finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
-holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
-prior to 60 days after the cessation.
-
-  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
-reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
-violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
-received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
-copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
-your receipt of the notice.
-
-  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
-licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
-this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
-reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
-material under section 10.
-
-  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
-
-  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
-run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
-occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
-to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
-nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
-modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
-not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
-covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
-
-  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
-
-  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
-receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
-propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
-for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
+Copyright (c) 2004-2011 Fabien Potencier
 
-  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
-organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
-organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
-work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
-transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
-licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
-give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
-Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
-the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
+Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
+of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
+in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
+to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
+copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished
+to do so, subject to the following conditions:
 
-  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
-rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
-not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
-rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
-any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
-sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
+The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
+copies or substantial portions of the Software.
 
-  11. Patents.
-
-  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
-License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
-work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
-
-  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
-owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
-hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
-by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
-but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
-consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
-purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
-patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
-this License.
-
-  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
-make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
-propagate the contents of its contributor version.
-
-  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
-agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
-(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
-sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
-party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
-patent against the party.
-
-  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
-and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
-to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
-publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
-then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
-available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
-patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
-consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
-license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
-actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
-covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
-in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
-country that you have reason to believe are valid.
-
-  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
-arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
-covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
-receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
-or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
-you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
-work and works based on it.
-
-  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
-the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
-conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
-specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
-work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
-in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
-to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
-the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
-parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
-patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
-conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
-for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
-contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
-or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
-
-  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
-any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
-otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
-
-  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
-
-  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
-covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
-not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
-to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
-the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
-License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
-
-  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
-
-  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
-permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
-under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
-combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
-License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
-but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
-section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
-combination as such.
-
-  14. Revised Versions of this License.
-
-  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
-the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-address new problems or concerns.
-
-  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
-Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
-Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
-option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
-version or of any later version published by the Free Software
-Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
-GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
-by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
-versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
-public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
-to choose that version for the Program.
-
-  Later license versions may give you additional or different
-permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
-author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
-later version.
-
-  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
-
-  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
-APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
-HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
-OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
-THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
-IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
-ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. Limitation of Liability.
-
-  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
-THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
-GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
-USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
-DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
-PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
-EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
-SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
-
-  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
-above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
-reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
-an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
-Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
-copy of the Program in return for a fee.
-
-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
-    (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-    GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
-notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
-might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
-
-  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
-if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
-For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
-<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
-
-  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
-into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
-may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
-the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
-Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
-<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

Designed as a drop in alternative to PHPUnit's phpunit-mock-objects library, Mockery is easy to integrate with PHPUnit and can operate alongside phpunit-mock-objects without the World ending.",
